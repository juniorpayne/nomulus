/**
 * Marker interface for Nomulus entities whose serialization are implemented in a fragile way. These
 * entities are made {@link Serializable} so that they can be passed between JVMs. The intended use
 * case is BEAM pipeline-based cross-database data validation between Datastore and Cloud SQL during
 * the migration. Note that only objects loaded from the SQL database need serialization support.
 *
 * <p>All entities implementing this interface take advantage of the fact that all Java collection
 * classes we use, either directly or indirectly, including those in Java libraries, Guava, and
 * Hibernate are {@code Serializable}.
 *
 * <p>The {@code serialVersionUID} field has also been omitted in the implementing classes, since
 * they are not used for persistence.

// TODO(b/203609782): either remove this interface or fix implementors post migration.
