Checks for post-deployment change to Flyway scripts.

With Flyway, once an incremental change script is deployed, it must not be
changed. Even changes to comments or whitespaces would cause validation
failures during future deployment. This script checks for changes (including
removal and renaming which may happen due to incorrect merge conflict
resolution) to scripts that have already been deployed to Sandbox. The
assumption is that the schema in Sandbox is always newer than that in
production.

A side-effect of this check is that old branches missing recently deployed
scripts must update first.

Options:

    -p, --project
            the GCP project with deployment infrastructure. It should
            take the devProject property defined in the Gradle root
