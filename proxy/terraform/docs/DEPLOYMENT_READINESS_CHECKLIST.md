  ```bash
  ./scripts/backup_terraform_state.sh production
  ./scripts/validate_state_backup.sh
  ```

- [ ] **Resource inventory**
  ```bash
  terraform state list > pre-deployment-resources.txt
  terraform show -json > pre-deployment-state.json
  ```

### Phase 2: Blue-Green Preparation (30 minutes)

- [ ] **Plan generation and review**
  ```bash
  terraform plan -var-file=production.tfvars -out=production-upgrade.tfplan

  ```

- [ ] **Plan review checklist**
  - [ ] No unexpected resource deletions
  - [ ] Resource modifications are expected
  - [ ] No sensitive data exposed in plan
  - [ ] Resource counts match expectations

- [ ] **Canary deployment**
