# This will delete canary GAE versions named "nomulus".
#
# For reasons unknown, Spinnaker occasionally gets stuck when deploying to GAE
# canary, and the fix is to manually delete the canary versions before the
# deployment.
#
# To manually trigger a build on GCB, run:
# gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild-delete-canary.yaml \
# --substitutions=_ENV=[ENV] ..
#
# To trigger a build automatically, follow the instructions below and add a trigger:
# https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/running-builds/automate-builds
#
steps:
# Pull the credential for nomulus tool.
