# To run the build locally, install cloud-build-local first.
# Then run:
# cloud-build-local --config=cloudbuild-delete.yaml --dryrun=false \
# --substitutions=TAG_NAME=[TAG],_ENV=[ENV] ..
#
# This will delete all stopped GAE versions (save 3) as there is a limit on how
# many versions can exist in a project.
#
# To manually trigger a build on GCB, run:
# gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild-delete.yaml \
# --substitutions=TAG_NAME=[TAG],_ENV=[ENV] ..
#
# To trigger a build automatically, follow the instructions below and add a trigger:
# https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/running-builds/automate-builds
#
# Note: to work around issue in Spinnaker's 'Deployment Manifest' stage,
# variable references must avoid the ${var} format. Valid formats include
# $var or ${"${var}"}. This file uses the former. Since TAG_NAME and _ENV are
# expanded in the copies sent to Spinnaker, we preserve the brackets around
# them for safe pattern matching during release.
# See https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues/3028 for more information.
#
# GAE has a limit of ~250 versions per-project, including unused versions. We
# therefore need to periodically delete old versions. This GCB job finds all
# stopped versions and delete all but the last 3 (in case we need to rollback).
