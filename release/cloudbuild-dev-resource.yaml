# To run the build locally, install cloud-build-local first.
# See: https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/build-debug-locally
# In the root of a nomulus source tree, run:
# cloud-build-local --config=cloudbuild-dev-resource.yaml --dryrun=false ..
#
# This will compile javadoc for the FOSS version of the code base and replace
# the content at gs://${PROJECT_ID}-javadoc with the it. The compiled javadoc
# can then be accesssed at https://storage.googleapis.com/${PROJECT_ID}-javadoc
#
# It will also upload all ER diagrams under db/src/main/resource/sql/er_diagram
# to gs://${PROJECT_ID}-er-diagram. The ER diagrams can then be accesssed
# at https://storage.googleapis.com/${PROJECT_ID}-er-diagram
#
# To trigger a build automatically, follow the instructions below and add a trigger:
# https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/running-builds/automate-builds
steps:
# Compile javadoc

  entrypoint: /bin/bash
  args: ['./gradlew', ':javadoc']
# Upload the files to GCS
# We don't use GCB's built-in artifacts uploader because we want to delete
# the existing files in the bucket first, and we want to parallelize the
# uploading process.
