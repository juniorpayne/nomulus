# This will do rolling restarts of all proxies. This forces the client to reconnect
# and resets the sessions.
#
# To manually trigger a build on GCB, run:
# gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild-restart-proxies.yaml \
# --substitutions=_ENV=[ENV] ..
#
# To trigger a build automatically, follow the instructions below and add a trigger:
# https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/running-builds/automate-builds
#
# Note: to work around the issue in Spinnaker's 'Deployment Manifest' stage,
# variable references must avoid the ${var} format. Valid formats include
# $var or ${"${var}"}. This file uses the former. Since TAG_NAME and _ENV are
# expanded in the copies sent to Spinnaker, we preserve the brackets around
# them for safe pattern matching during release.
# See https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues/3028 for more information.
