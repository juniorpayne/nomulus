# To run the build locally, install cloud-build-local first.
# Then run:
# cloud-build-local --config=cloudbuild-tag.yaml --dryrun=false --substitutions \
#   TAG_NAME=[TAG],_IMAGE=[IMAGE] ..
# This will add a "live" tag to the image in gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]/[IMAGE]:[TAG].
# The PROJECT_ID is the current project name that gcloud uses.
#
# To manually trigger a build on GCB, run:
# gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild-tag.yaml --substitutions \
#   TAG_NAME=[TAG],_IMAGE=[IMAGE] ..
#
# To trigger a build automatically, follow the instructions below and add a trigger:
# https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/running-builds/automate-builds
#
# Note: to work around issue in Spinnaker's 'Deployment Manifest' stage,
# variable references must avoid the ${var} format. Valid formats include
# $var or ${"${var}"}. This file use the former. Since TAG_NAME is
# expanded in the copies sent to Spinnaker, we preserve the brackets around
# them for safe pattern matching during release.
# See https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues/3028 for more information.
