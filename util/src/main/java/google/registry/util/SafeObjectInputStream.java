/**
 * Safely deserializes Nomulus http request parameters.
 *
 * <p>Serialized Java objects may be passed between Nomulus components that hold different
 * credentials. Deserialization of such objects should be protected against attacks through
 * compromised accounts.
 *
 * <p>This class protects against three types of attacks by restricting the classes used for
 * serialization:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Remote code execution by referencing bad classes in compromised jars. When a class with
 *       malicious code in the static initialization block or the deserialization code path (e.g.,
 *       the {@code readObject} method) is deserialized, such code will be executed. For Nomulus,
 *       this risk comes from third-party dependencies. To counter this risk, this class only allows
 *       Nomulus (google.registry.**) classes and specific core Java classes, and forbid others
 *       including third-party dependencies. (As a side note, this class does not use allow lists
 *       for Nomulus or third-party classes because it is infeasible in practice. Super classes of
 *       the instance being deserialized must be resolved, and therefore must be on the allow list;
 *       same for the field types of the instance. The allow list for the Joda {@code DateTime}
 *       class alone would have more than 10 classes. Generated classes, e.g., by AutoValue, present
 *       another problem: their real names are not meant to be a concern to the user).
 *   <li>CPU-targeting denial-of-service attacks. Containers and arrays may be used to construct
 *       object graphs that require enormous amount of computation during deserialization and/or
 *       during invocations of methods such as {@code hashCode} or {@code equals}, taking minutes or
 *       even hours to complete. See <a
 *       href="https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Deserialization_of_untrusted_data">
 *       here</a> for an example of such object graphs. To counter this risk, this class forbids
 *       lists, maps, and arrays for deserialization.
 *   <li>Memory-targeting denial-of-service attacks. By forbidding container and arrays, this class
 *       also prevents some memory-targeting attacks, e.g., using wire format that claims to be an
 *       array of a huge size, causing the JVM to preallocate excessive amount of memory and
 *       triggering the {@code OutOfMemoryError}. This is actually a small risk for Nomulus, since
 *       the impact of each error is limited to a single (spurious) request.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Nomulus classes with fields of array, container, or third-party Java types must implement
 * their own serialization/deserialization methods to be safely deserialized. For the common use
 * case of passing a collection of `safe` objects, {@link
 * SafeSerializationUtils#serializeCollection} and {@link
 * SafeSerializationUtils#safeDeserializeCollection} may be used.
